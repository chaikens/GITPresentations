For the first time in our department's history, we have the students
in a large lecture based undergraduate computer science major course
use GIT.  The course is computer organization. It has about 6 small C
programming projects which are required but supplemental to the main
modalities of reading and written problem set assignments. GIT use is
required by students to download programming project frameworks,
document a history of incremental development and testing, and submit
their work for grading.  We report some technical challenges and
solutions, instructions and support given to the students, and our
observations and preliminary survey and other feedback results.  The
technology consists of git and ssh software for us and the students
plus gitolite in a departmentally run Linux server.
